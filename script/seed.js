        'White tea is made from the young tea bud. It is plucked just before the leaf opens on the stem and is air-dried to lock in its color and flavor. The chlorophyll is not mature in this bud and that gives its “white” appearance. We add flavors to make delicate and delectable teas. Look for gently sweet notes ranging from honeysuckle to light maple sap, citrus fruit flavors like orange and lemon, and wisps of floral aromas, evoking jasmine and rose. The delicacy of white tea leaves allows wonderfully subtle flavors to flourish in your freshly brewed cup!',

We begin with subtle hand-picked Chinese Mutan White tea, full of light vegetal flavors, and augment its smooth and welcoming palate with sweet notes of peach for a body that's strong without being brash. Finally, an even-handed touch of natural vanilla swirls through, bringing this reliably enjoyable brew to a close",

Swirling flavors of cocoa and vanilla layer throughout the tea, accented with cocoa nibs and just a hint of brandy flavor. The result is a shimmering, deliciously complex infusion that summons up visions of Venice in every sip.',
